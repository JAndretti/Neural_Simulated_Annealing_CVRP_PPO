# Learning-Guided Simulated Annealing for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing (LG-SA)

A reinforcement learning framework that solves the **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)** by hybridizing **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** with **Simulated Annealing (SA)**. This approach, **LG-SA**, leverages the exploration capabilities of SA and the learnable guidance of a neural policy to find high-quality routing solutions.

## 📌 Overview

Traditional heuristics often struggle to balance exploration and exploitation in large combinatorial spaces. **LG-SA** addresses this by using a neural network (Actor) to propose local moves (like swaps or 2-opt) within a Simulated Annealing framework. The network is trained via PPO to maximize the probability of accepting improved solutions or minimizing total route cost.

### Key Features

  * **Hybrid Optimization**: Integrates the Metropolis acceptance criterion of Simulated Annealing with a learnable neural proposal distribution.
  * **Deep Reinforcement Learning**: Uses PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) with Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) to train the policy.
  * **Parallel Environment**: Solves hundreds of CVRP instances simultaneously on GPU for efficient training.
  * **Flexible Heuristics**: Supports multiple move operators including `swap`, `2-opt`, and mixed strategies.
  * **Adaptive Cooling**: Implements advanced temperature scheduling (Linear, Exponential, Cosine) to manage exploration.
  * **Experiment Tracking**: Native integration with [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/site/) for real-time monitoring of losses, rewards, and solution improvements.

## 🛠️ Installation

This project uses **[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)** for fast and reliable dependency management, requiring **Python 3.12+**.

### 1\. Prerequisites

Ensure you have `uv` installed. If not:

```bash
pip install uv
```

### 2\. Setup

Clone the repository and initialize the environment:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/JAndretti/Learning_Guided_Simulated_Annealing_for_the_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing.git
cd Learning_Guided_Simulated_Annealing_for_the_Capacitated_Vehicle_Routing

# Install dependencies and setup environment
# This runs settings.py which handles environment creation and optional DB downloads
uv run settings.py
```

*Note: Edit `settings.py` or the configuration if you wish to enable/disable automatic database downloads.*

### 3\. WandB Configuration

To enable experiment tracking:

1.  Create a file `src/key.txt`.
2.  Paste your [Weights & Biases API key](https://wandb.ai/settings) into the file.
3.  Alternatively, set `LOG: False` in `src/HyperParameters/HP.yaml` to run without logging.

## 🚀 Usage

### Training

To start a standard training session using the default configuration:

```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

### Hyperparameter Search

To run a sweep (grid search) over hyperparameters:

```bash
uv run launch_HP_sweep.py
```

### Configuration

All hyperparameters are centrally managed in `src/HyperParameters/HP.yaml`. You can modify this file to adjust the experiment:

| Parameter | Default | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `PROBLEM_DIM` | `100` | Number of nodes (customers) in the CVRP. |
| `N_PROBLEMS` | `512` | Batch size (number of parallel environments). |
| `MODEL` | `seq` | Architecture type (`seq` or `pairs`). |
| `HEURISTIC` | `insertion` | Local search operator (`insertion`, `swap`, `two_opt`). |
| `INIT_TEMP` | `1.0` | Initial temperature for Simulated Annealing. |
| `DEVICE` | `cuda` | Compute device (`cuda`, `mps`, or `cpu`). |

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1\. The Environment (`problem.py`)

The environment simulates batches of CVRP instances. It manages:

  * **State**: Current vehicle routes, capacities, and visited nodes.
  * **Constraints**: Ensures no vehicle exceeds `MAX_LOAD`.
  * **Initialization**: Supports `random`, `greedy`, and `sweep` initialization strategies.

### 2\. Neural Architecture (`model.py`)

  * **Actor (Policy)**: A neural network that observes the current solution and outputs a probability distribution over possible modification moves (e.g., which node to move and where).
  * **Critic (Value)**: Estimates the quality of the current state, serving as a baseline to reduce variance in gradient updates.

### 3\. Training Loop (SA + PPO)

The training process alternates between experience collection and policy updates:

1.  **Experience Collection (SA Phase)**:

      * The **Actor** proposes a modification to the current route.
      * The **Environment** calculates the change in cost ($\Delta Cost$).
      * **Metropolis Criterion**: The move is accepted if it improves cost OR with probability $e^{-\Delta Cost / T}$ (controlled by temperature $T$).
      * Transitions $(s, a, r, s')$ are stored in a Replay Buffer.

2.  **Policy Update (PPO Phase)**:

      * Transitions are sampled from the buffer.
      * **GAE (Generalized Advantage Estimation)** is computed using the Critic.
      * The Actor and Critic are updated via gradient descent to maximize expected reward (cost reduction) while clipping large policy updates for stability.
