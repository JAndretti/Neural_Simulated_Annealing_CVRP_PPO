# Generated Problem Directory Overview

This document explains the purpose of each file and folder in the `generated_problem` directory.

## Python Files

### generate_pb.py
This script automates the generation of problem instances and organizes them into folders.  
- **Process**:  
  - Searches for `.sh` scripts in the `scripts_gen` folder.  
  - Creates a corresponding folder in `bdd_generated` for each script.  
  - Executes the script to generate problem instances.  
  - Moves `.vrp` files (problem instances) into the appropriate folder.  

### generator.py
This script contains the logic for generating problem instances based on specific parameters.  
- **Purpose**: Used by `generate_pb.py` to create `.vrp` files.  


This file was developed by:

- **Uchoa et al. (2017)**: *New benchmark instances for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem*. European Journal of Operational Research.  
- **Queiroga, Eduardo, et al. (2022)**: *10,000 optimal CVRP solutions for testing machine learning-based heuristics*.

## Folders

### bdd_generated
This folder contains subdirectories named `gen<number>` (e.g., `gen1`, `gen2`), `<number>` being the number of clients.  
- **Contents**:  
  - Each subdirectory corresponds to a generated problem set.  
  - Includes `.vrp` files (problem instances) and other related files.

### scripts_gen
This folder contains `.sh` scripts used for generating problem instances.  
- **Purpose**: Each script defines specific parameters for generating a set of problems.
